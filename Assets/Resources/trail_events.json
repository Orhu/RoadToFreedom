A dog barks somewhere, sending a drop of cold sweat down your spine - but it doesn't sound like a tracker hound, thank the Lord.

The old Black lady, you learn, was once from Georgia, and the withered scars on her muscled arms tell you that she didn't live there as a free woman.
                    \nWhen the wall is leveled out and the brick gaps filled, she stands back, mopping her brow. 'I think I've worked you hard enough, young 'un,' she says. 'Can't pause your tour too long, eh?'
                    \nYou're sweaty, but seeing the wall level is oddly satisfying. The sun has shifted in the sky, though, and you're antsy to get back on the road. You nod to her.
                    \nShe vanishes into the cellar of the house and reemerges with a bag of food and a few coins. 'Good luck,' she says, serious now.
                    \nYou can feel her eyes on you as you take to the road again.

The water beats against you, sucking at your legs and threataning to suck you under, but you kick and splash, pulling yourself through it against the current and towards the opposite shore. A bridge support sticks out of the water about halfway through; you grasp this for a moment to catch your breath before plunging on.
                    \nYour feet brush sand again. You gasp with relief and struggle for balance, then slosh your way out of the water and collapse onshore to catch your breath. You survived, and so did your bag, which although sodden, holds all of your belongings. You rest there until you can breathe easy again, then climb the opposite embankment to continue along the road.

You get a desperate gasp of air before you're dragged under, kicking and flailing.
                    \nLuckily, the river spits you out rather than pulling you to a watery death. You find yourself sprawled in a calm pocket half-mile away from the road, bruised all down your torso from where the river threw you against the rocky far shore. Worse, your bag popped open in the flood, and while your shoes are still there, much of your food and a few bottles of medicine got washed away.
                    \nYou're across the river now, at least, you tell yourself, to abate your sinking dread. You rest there until you can breathe easy again, then climb the opposite embankment to continue along the road with a lighter pack and a heavier heart.
