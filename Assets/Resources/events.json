Horse-drawn carriages speed by with barely a thought, leaving you to dodge the spray of dirt and pounding hooves. Shopkeepers shout their wares from beneath fabric awnings along the wide boulevards; pedestrians curse at the reckless carriages and yell to one another.You've never seen so many people in one place, and you find yourself slack-jawed as the crowds jostle and push you.
